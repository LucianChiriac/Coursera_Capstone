    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The titanic was one of the world's greatest tragedies as well as one of the most unexpected ones, as the ship - the biggest in the world at the time, and widely regarded as \"unsinkable\" - has sunk on the first voyage after hitting an iceberg. Most of the 2200 passengers did not survive the accident. Our analysis tries to explore, using the available information, \"who\" survived - that is, what characteristics determined if a passenger will get a seat on a lifeboat or not. It it status, is it sex, is it age, is it all of it and more? Or was it all mere luck?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Target audience\n",
    "##### Although nothing can be done for the victims of the titanic anymore, the tragedy is worth exploring in order to understand human behaviour in critical situations. Social Study scholars may want to explore how does one decide which life is worth saving, or in other words, how is the value of the life measured (at least how it was back in the days of the titanic). It is the case that in life and death situations, all lives are equal? Or is it the case that some lives are valued more than others, and if so, what determines how?"
